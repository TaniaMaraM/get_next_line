I need an alarm system in my house
So I know when people are
Creepin about, these people are
Freakin me out (these days)
It's getting hectic everywhere that I go
They won't leave me alone
There's things they all wanna know
I'm paranoid about the people I meet
Why are they talking to me?
And why can't anyone see?

I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live
(Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live
Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live)

I rock a law suit when I'm goin to court
A white suit when I'm gettin divorced
A black suit at the funeral home
And my birthday suit when I'm home alone
Talkin' on the phone got an interview
With the Rolling Stone they're saying
Now your rich and now your famous
Fake-ass girls all know your name and
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Your first, hit aren't you ashamed?
Of the life, of the life
Of the life we're living

I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live

Stop your messin around, boy!
Better think of your future
Better make some good plans, boy!
Said everyone of my teachers
Look out you better play it safe
You never know what hard times will come your way
We say where we're coming from
We've already seen the worst of this life can bring

Now we expect it everywhere that we go
All the things that they say
Yeah, we already know

I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what others will think
(Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live)
I just wanna live
(Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live)
I just wanna live
(Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live)
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what others will think
I just wanna live
